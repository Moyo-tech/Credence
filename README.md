## Project Description

Credence is an eco-friendly mobile application that offers small businesses a platform to showcase their products and services, and facilitates sales through the generation of digital receipts instead of paper receipts.

**The problem**: Small businesses in Rwanda faced challenges with finding an effective platform to promote their products and services. Additionally, there was a lack of a central platform for individuals to verify business authenticity and make purchases.

Credence solves this problem by providing a convenient and accessible platform for small businesses while also supporting environmental sustainability. Paper receipts, which are made of thermal paper, cannot be recycled and are harmful to the environment. With Credence, users can easily keep track of their transactions and expenses through the use of digital receipts, as well as have a reliable platform for future purchases from small businesses.
